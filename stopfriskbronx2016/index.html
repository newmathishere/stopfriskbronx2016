<p>This month, a federal court-appointed monitor of the New York City Police Department <a href="http://nypdmonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-13-FloydLigonDavis-Monitor-Seventh-Report_EAST_80301353_1.pdf">released the latest report</a> on the agency’s efforts to keeping the practice of stop-and-frisk within constitutional limits.</p>

<p>The monitor has been releasing regular reports on stop-and-frisk ever since a federal judge ruled the practice unconstitutional in the 2013 case Floyd v. City of New York. The judge said that temporarily detaining suspects on the street and searching them for weapons and contraband had been shown to unfairly target black and Latino men. In the years since the ruling, the NYPD has significantly curbed stop and frisk. In 2013, the NYPD made 191,558 stops citywide. In 2016, officers made 12,404 stops, representing a 93 percent drop over those four years.</p>

	<p>In the Bronx, where most of the plaintiffs in the Floyd case reside, police made 2,460 stops in 2016. </p>

	<p>In reports released this year, the NYPD monitor team, led by attorney Philip Zimroth, has noted that racial disparities persist in the program, even though police have dramatically reduced their practice of it. In the latest monitor report, released on December 13, Zimroth noted that despite new training officers and their supervisors have been receiving, underreporting of stops and frisks has become a problem:</p>

<p>“Some officers making stops do not file the required stop forms documenting them, in part because of what appears to be an exaggerated fear of discipline and lawsuits. The monitor team has heard from some officers that completing stop reports “is not worth the trouble,” even though there are more serious consequences for not documenting a stop in a report than for making inadvertent mistakes in a stop,” the report says.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>“Some officers making stops do not file the required stop forms documenting them, in part because of what appears to be an exaggerated fear of discipline and lawsuits. ”</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>The underreporting issue may be one factor that influences the reduced numbers of stops since 2013. But there are still questions about the program’s effectiveness in actually deterring crime. In the Bronx last year, about 26 percent of stops resulted in an arrest. And only five percent of stops resulted in a court summons.</p>
